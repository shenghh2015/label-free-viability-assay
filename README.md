# Label-free-viability-assay

The trained E-U-Net models for the HeLa and CHO cell images, respectively.

# Step 1: Installation

pip install -r requirement.txt

# Step 2: Model download
HeLa model (EfficientNet-B3): already in the trained_models folder

CHO model (EfficientNet-B7): need to download and put it into trained_models folder

# Step 3: 
Usage of HeLa model: inspect_HeLa_model.ipynb
Usage of CHO model: inspect_CHO_model.ipynb
